# kjg brewfile

## Why

This file helps install my most needed apps on a new Mac

## How to use

This will get downloaded and run automatically via [strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap).
Or use `brew bundle [install] --file <location of Brewfile>`

## Getting started from scratch

running `brew bundle dump` will create a Brewfile in the current working directory with all your homebrew and Mac Appstore apps added
